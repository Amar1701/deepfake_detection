# deepfake_detection
We've created a DeepFake Detection system which intends to detect DeepFake videos using Deep Learning techniques like ResNext and LSTM.In this code, we've integrated Intel OneAPI ONEDAL for PCA preprocessing by using its PCA implementation. Additionally, we've imported tbb for potential parallel processing tasks.
